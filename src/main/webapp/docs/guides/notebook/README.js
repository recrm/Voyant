Voyant Tools provides a suite of text analysis tools including visualization tools and statistical analysis. Spyral Notebooks are integrated with Voyant to provide an environment for extending literary text analysis, writing reports, and sharing analysis with other researchers. Notebook environments can be thought of both as extensions of traditional research notebooks and as novel tools that integrate active analysis and presentation of results. Spyral is designed to give researchers a collaborative platform for working through textual analysis projects in an intuitive, user-friendly environment.</p>\n\n<p>Spyral was designed in the tradition of \"literate programming\" where the development environment supports the intertwining of discussion and code so that development starts with describing what is being done for others. This type of programming is particularly beneficial in digital humanities projects in which the analytical code is usually accompanied by textual explanations and in which the textual accompaniments to code and visualizations are just as important as the analysis itself.</p>\n\n<h2 id='notebook-section-example-notebooks'>Example Notebooks</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"//voyant-tools.org/spyral/learnspyral@gh/aboutspyral/\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Spyral Notebooks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"//voyant-tools.org/spyral/learnspyral@gh/Tutorials/\" target=\"_blank\">Spyral Tutorials</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"//voyant-tools.org/spyral/learnspyral@gh/homeALTA/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Literary Text Analysis with Spyral Notebooks</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 id='notebook-section-api'>API</h2>\n\n<p>View the <a href=\"#!/api\">Spyral API</a>, which outlines all the available classes and methods.</p>\n","title":"About Spyral"});
