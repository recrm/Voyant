# StreamGraph
	
StreamGraph is a visualization that depicts the change of the frequency of words in a corpus (or within a single document).

Use it with a <a href="../?view=StreamGraph&corpus=austen" target="_blank">Jane Austen corpus</a> or with <a href="../?view=StreamGraph" target="_blank">your own corpus</a>.


## Overview


StreamGraph is intended to be used with a corpus that contain several documents and where the order of the documents is meaningful (such as chronological order); it can also be used with a single document that gets automatically segmented.

Each horizontal line in the graph is coloured according to the word it represents, at the top of the graph a legend displays which words are associated with which colours. Hovering over any point on the graph provides additional information. The horizontal (x) axis shows brief labels for either the documents or the document segment. The vertical (y) axis shows either relative or raw term frequencies. Raw term frequencies are the actual count for each term, while relative term frequencies are calculated by dividing the raw term frequency by the total number of terms (per document or document segment).

You can toggle specific terms by clicking on them in the legend at the top.
