# Corpus Terms

Corpus Terms is a table view of term frequencies in the entire corpus.

Use it with a [Jane Austen corpus](../?view=CorpusTerms&corpus=austen) or with [your own corpus](../?view=CorpusTerms).

## Overview

The table view shows the following three data columns by default:

- *Term*: this is the term in the corpus
- *Count*: this is the frequency of the term in the corpus
- *Trends*: this is a sparkline graph that shows the distribution of relative frequencies across documents in the corpus (if the corpus contains more than one document); you can hover over the sparkline to see finer-grained results

Additional columns are available by clicking on the down arrow that appears in the right side of a column header:

- *Relative*: this is the relative frequency of the term in the corpus (calculated by dividing the raw frequency by the total number of terms in the corpus and multiplying by 1 million). Sorting by count and relative should produce the same results, the relative frequencies might be useful when comparing to another corpus.
- *Comparison*: this is the relative frequency of the term in the corpus compared to the relative frequency of the same term in a comparison corpus; to specify the comparison corpus, click the {@tutorial options} icon and specify the comparison corpus to use
- *Peakedness*: this is a [statistical measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) of how much the relative frequencies of a term in a corpus are bunched up into peaks (regions with higher values where the rest are lower)
- *Skew*: this is a [statistical measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) of the symmetry of the relative frequencies of a term across the corpus

By default, the most frequent terms in the corpus are shown.

## Options

You can specify terms by typing a query into the search box and hitting enter (see {@tutorial search} for more advanced searching capabilities).

Clicking on the {@tutorial options} icon allows you to define a set of stopwords to exclude â€“ see the {@tutorial stopwords} 
for more information.

You can also specify a comparison corpus by copying and pasting a comparison corpus ID (or selecting one of the 
pre-defined ones). The comparison is used for relative frequencies. You also need to show the "Comparison" column in
the grid.

## Spyral

To use Corpus Terms in Spyral you can use the following code as a starting point. Modify the config object to modify 
the visualization.

```

let config = {
    bins: null, // for the purposes of analyzing distribution the documents are split into a specified number of segments or bins
    docIndex: null, // document index to restrict to (can be comma-separated list)
    expand: null, // the size of the extended context (when you expand a context occurrence), the number of words on each side of the keyword
    query: null, // a query for the keywords (can be comma-separated list)
    stopList: null, // a named stopword list or comma-separated list of words
};

loadCorpus("austen").tool("Corpusterms", config);

```
