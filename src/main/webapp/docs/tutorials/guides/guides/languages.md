# Languages

Voyant Tools supports multilingualism in various ways.

## Interface Languages

The user interface of Voyant Tools is available in several languages. By default Voyant Tools will detect the browser's language preferences and present the interface in the first available language (or English if no others are available). The following languages are available (in various stages of completion):

* [Arabic](../?lang=ar)
* [Bosnian](../?lang=bs)
* [Croatian](../?lang=hr)
* [Czech](../?lang=cz)
* [English](../?lang=en)
* [French](../?lang=fr)
* [German](../?lang=de)
* [Hebrew](../?lang=he)
* [Italian](../?lang=it)
* [Japanese](../?lang=ja)
* [Portuguese](../?lang=pt)
* [Russian](../?lang=ru)
* [Serbian](../?lang=sr)
* [Spanish](../?lang=es)

Note that the interface of Arabic and Hebrew are by default displayed in [right-to-left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left) mode.

You can override the browser language preference in two places:

* on the home screen when you hover over the grey "Add Texts" bar and click the languages icon
* in the default skin when you hover over the top blue "Voyant Tools" bar and click the languages icon

Once you click the language icon a menu will appear with the available languages - select one and hit the confirm 
button (this will cause Voyant to reload with other existing parameters).

## Document Languages

Independently of the interface language, Voyant Tools supports analysis of documents in multiple languages. In fact, 
in some ways Voyant Tools supports analysis in _any_ language since it mostly operates on character sequences (this 
wide generic support is an advantage, it's also a disadvantage since there's very little language-specific 
functionality, such as [part-of-speech tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)).   

Some limited language-specific handling is built into the document 
[tokenizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_(lexical_analysis)), the algorithm that determines what words 
are. In many languages this can be as simple as looking for letter sequences (interrupted by spaces and punctuation),
but in other languages there are breaks between between what might be considered words. In addition to some 
language-specific awareness (notably for Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages), Voyant does have some 
[limited options]{@tutorial corpuscreator} for overriding the default tokenization behaviour.       

An important factor for multilingual support is character encoding of source documents. For many input formats the 
character encoding is handled by the file type and no special handling is needed (XML, PDF, MS Word, etc.). One 
notable exception is plain text: Voyant will do its best to guess at the character encoding, but for best results 
its best to provide plain texts in Unicode (UTF-8).

Some languages use a right-to-left script. If you select the Arabic or Hebrew interface, the text orientation should 
adjust automatically. It's also possible to use other interface languages and force right-to-left display by 
specifying the "[rtl=true](../?rtl=true)" as part of the URL.
