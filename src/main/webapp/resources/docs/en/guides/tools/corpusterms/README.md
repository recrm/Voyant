# Corpus Terms

Corpus Terms is a table view of term frequencies in the entire corpus.

Use it with a <a href="../?view=CorpusTerms&corpus=austen" target="_blank">Jane Austen corpus</a> or with <a href="../?view=CorpusTerms" target="_blank">your own corpus</a>.

## Overview

The table view shows the following three data columns by default:

- *Term*: this is the term in the corpus
- *Count*: this is the frequency of the term in the corpus
- *Trends*: this is a sparkline graph that shows the distribution of relative frequencies across documents in the corpus (if the corpus contains more than one document); you can hover over the sparkline to see finer-grained results

Additional columns are available by clicking on the down arrow that appears in the right side of a column header:

- *Relative*: this is the relative frequency of the term in the corpus (calculated by dividing the raw frequency by the total number of terms in the corpus and multiplying by 1 million). Sorting by count and relative should produce the same results, the relative frequencies might be useful when comparing to another corpus.
- *Comparison*: this is the relative frequency of the term in the corpus compared to the relative frequency of the same term in a comparison corpus; to specify the comparison corpus, click the [Options](#!/guide/options) icon and specify the comparison corpus to use
- *Peakedness*: this is a [statistical measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) of how much the relative frequencies of a term in a corpus are bunched up into peaks (regions with higher values where the rest are lower)
- *Skew*: this is a [statistical measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) of the symmetry of the relative frequencies of a term across the corpus

By default, the most frequent terms in the corpus are shown.

## Options

You can specify terms by typing a query into the search box and hitting enter (see [Term Searches](#!/guide/search) for more advanced searching capabilities).

Clicking on the [Options](#!/guide/options) icon allows you to define a set of stopwords to exclude â€“ see the [stopwords guide](#!/guide/stopwords) for more information.

You can also specify a comparison corpus by copying and pasting a comparison corpus ID (or selecting one of the pre-defined ones). The comparison is used for relative frequencies. You also need to show the "Comparison" column in the grid.
