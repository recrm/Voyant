# Correlations

The Correlations tool enables an exploration of the extent to which term frequencies vary in sync (terms whose frequencies rise and fall together or inversely).

Use it with a [Jane Austen corpus](../?view=Correlations&corpus=austen) or with [your own corpus](../?view=Correlations).

## Overview

The table view shows the following columns by default:

- *Term 1*: the first term of the pair (the order or the terms doesn't matter)
- *Trends*: two sparklines (mini graphs) that show the distribution of relative frequencies (the left one is for Term 1 and the right one is for Term 2)
- *Term 2*: the second term of the pair (the order or the terms doesn't matter)
- *Correlation*: the Pearsons correlation coefficient for this pair of words
- *Significance*: the siginficance of the correlation value (lower is better)

By default, correlations are shown for the corpus, unless the corpus contains only one document, in which case 
correlations are show for terms in that one document.

The correlation coefficient is calculated by comparing the relative frequencies of terms (relative to each document for 
the corpus or relative to each segment of document). A coefficient that approaches 1 indicates that values correlate 
positively, they rise and fall together. A coefficient that approaches -1 indicates that values correlate negatively, 
frequencies rise for one term as it drops for the other. Coefficients that approach 0 indicate little correlation, 
positive or negative. This value is the Pearsons correlation as calculated by the 
[Apache Math Commons library SimpleRegression class](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/javadocs/api-3.6.1/org/apache/commons/math3/stat/regression/SimpleRegression.html).

This significance value is a measure of confidence in the correlation value. Often a significance of .05 or less 
indicates a strong correlation (which allows us to reject the null hypothesis that values are randomly distributed). 
The validity of this measure depends on assumptions about a normal distribution of the data. Also, don't forget that we 
typically have a relatively small number of values (frequencies from segments in a texts or from texts in a document), 
so these values should be used with care.

## Options

You can specify which keyword to use by typing a query into the search box and hitting enter (see {@tutorial search}
for more advanced searching capabilities).

You can determine the minimum coverage (as a percentage) for terms using the provided slider. The coverage determines 
how many of the relative frequency values can be zero before the term is excluded. For instance, if a corpus has 10 
documents and the minimum coverage is 20%, at least two of the documents must contain the term or it will be ignored.

If your corpus has more than one document you will see a Scale button that will allow you to toggle between the entire 
corpus and one or more individual documents. Again, the values change: for a corpus, it's the relative frequency for 
each document; for a document, it's the relative frequency for each segment.

Clicking on the {@tutorial options} icon also allows you to define a set of stopwords to exclude â€“ see the 
{@tutorial stopwords} for more information.

## Spyral

To use Correlations in Spyral you can use the following code as a starting point. Modify the config object to modify 
the visualization.

```

let config = {
    columns: null, 
    SortDir: null, 
    DocId: null, 
    DocIndex: null, 
    minInDocumentsCountRatio: null, 
    Query: null, 
    SortColumn: null, 
    StopList: null,
    TermColors: null,
    WithDistributions: null
};

loadCorpus("austen").tool("Correlations", config);

```

Please see {@link Tools.Correlations} for more information about configuration.

## Additional Information

The Correlations tool uses [Pearson's Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient), 
which is a robust measure but assumes that values are distributed normally on an interval scale.
