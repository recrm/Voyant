# StreamGraph
	
StreamGraph is a visualization that depicts the change of the frequency of words in a corpus (or within a single document).

Use it with a [Jane Austen corpus](../?view=StreamGraph&corpus=austen) or with [your own corpus](../?view=StreamGraph).


## Overview


StreamGraph is intended to be used with a corpus that contain several documents and where the order of the documents is 
meaningful (such as chronological order); it can also be used with a single document that gets automatically segmented.

Each horizontal line in the graph is coloured according to the word it represents, at the top of the graph a legend 
displays which words are associated with which colours. Hovering over any point on the graph provides additional 
information. The horizontal (x) axis shows brief labels for either the documents or the document segment. The vertical 
(y) axis shows either relative or raw term frequencies. Raw term frequencies are the actual count for each term, while 
relative term frequencies are calculated by dividing the raw term frequency by the total number of terms (per document 
or document segment).

You can toggle specific terms by clicking on them in the legend at the top.

## Options

You can add keywords by typing a query into the search box and hitting enter (see {@tutorial search} for more advanced 
searching capabilities).

You can use the _Clear_ button to clear all keywords in the graph (to start from scratch and add your own).

Clicking on the {@tutorial options} icon also allows you to define a set of stopwords to exclude â€“ see the 
{@tutorial stopwords} for more information.

## Spyral

To use Streamgraph widget in Spyral you can use the following code as a starting point. Modify the config object to 
modify the visualization.

```
let config = {
    "Bins": null,
    "DocId": null,
    "DocIndex": null,
    "Limit": null,
    "Query": null,
    "StopList": null,
    "WithDistributions": null
}; 

loadCorpus("austen").tool("Streamgraph", config);
```

Please see {@link Tools.Streamgraph} for more information about configuration.
