# Skins

## Default Skin

The default skin includes the following tools:

1. [Cirrus]{@tutorial cirrus}
1. [Reader]{@tutorial reader}
1. [Trends]{@tutorial trends}
1. [Summary]{@tutorial summary}
1. [Contexts]{@tutorial contexts}


<iframe src="../?corpus=austen" style="width: 90%; height: 600px;"></iframe>
<div style="width: 90%; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">Voyant with the Works of Jane Austen. You can also <a href="../" target="_blank">use Voyant with your own corpus</a>.</div>

The various tools in the interface are designed to interact with one another. For instance, if you click on a word in 
[Cirrus]{@tutorial cirrus}, youâ€™ll see the [Trends]{@tutorial trends} tool update with information about the selected 
work. Similarly, if you click on a node in the [Trends]{@tutorial trends} tool the [Contexts]{@tutorial contexts} 
tool should update as well. Interactivity and navigation between the different scales of a corpus (from the macroscopic 
[Cirrus]{@tutorial cirrus} overview to the microscopic individual word occurrences) are a key part of the design of 
Voyant Tools.

Additional tools are readily accessible by clicking the tabs in each tool pane. For instance, beside the 
[Cirrus]{@tutorial cirrus} header label is the [Corpus Terms]{@tutorial corpusterms} label, clicking on the tab will 
switch the tool. Tools readily available through the tabs are [Corpus Terms]{@tutorial corpusterms} 
[Links]{@tutorial links}, [Collocates]{@tutorial corpuscollocates}, [Documents]{@tutorial documents}, 
[Phrases]{@tutorial phrases}, and [Bubblelines]{@tutorial bubblelines}.

Beyond the tools visible in the tabs, it's possible to access most of the other tools available by clicking on the 
window icon that appears when the mouse is in the header of a tool (grey) or of the skin (blue). The menu that appears 
shows recommended tools for that location above the line and a hierarchy of other tools below the line.

## Special Skins

In addition to the default skin (that can be used with [Austen](../?corpus=austen) or [your own corpus](../)) there are 
several pre-defined skins that combine a subset of tools, including:

* *Bubblelines Skin*: the [bubblelines]{@tutorial bubblelines} tool combined with the [contexts]{@tutorial contexts} and [reader]{@tutorial reader} tools (use with [Austen](../?corpus=austen&view=bubblelinesset) or [your own corpus](../?view=bubblelinesset))
* *Collocates Skin*: [corpus terms]{@tutorial corpusterms}, [document terms]{@tutorial documentterms}, [corpus collocates]{@tutorial corpuscollocates}, [contexts]{@tutorial contexts}, and [collocates graph]{@tutorial collocatesgraph} (use with [Austen](../?corpus=austen&view=collocatesset) or [your own corpus](../?view=collocatesset))
* *Scatter Skin*: [scatterplot (PCA and CA)]{@tutorial scatterplot} with [documents]{@tutorial documents}, [trends]{@tutorial trends} and [contexts]{@tutorial contexts} (use with [Austen](../?corpus=austen&view=scatterset) or [your own corpus](../?view=scatterset))
* *Subset Skin*: a specialized interface to select a subset of documents from your corpus (for download or for use in Voyant), based on full-text and metadata search (use with [Austen](../?corpus=austen&view=subset) or [your own corpus](../?view=subset))


## Dynamic Table of Contexts Skin

The Dynamic Table of Contexts Browser is an online reading environment for digitally encoded texts that allows for 
complex searches combining the table of contents with semantic tagging, index items, and free-text searching.

The Dynamic Table of Contexts developed from the question of how best to leverage the kind of tagging or semantic 
markup used in the digital humanities to publish born digital scholarship involving long-form argumentation of the kind 
found in scholarly books. The browser, which resembles an e-book interface of the kind encountered at websites such as 
archive.org, combines tagging of the structure of the text with the tagging of named entities (people, places, 
organizations, titles) and with search functionality. Together, these provide users with a unique environment for 
browsing and navigating through the digital book, one that combines the Table of Contents with the Index. The result is 
a dynamic browsing environment in which the user can see where the materials that interest her are located within the 
structure of the volume.
