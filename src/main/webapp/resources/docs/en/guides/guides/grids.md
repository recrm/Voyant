# Grids

Several Voyant Tools display results in a grid or table. Although the exact appearance of tables will change according to the tool, several interface elements are common.

* most tools allow for row selection: select a row by clicking on it, select multiple rows by using the Shift or Ctrl/Command key
* selected rows should persist even when querying for additional data
* hover over the column header to get a short description of the column values
* some columns allow you to sort values by that column by clicking on it (and clicking again to reverse the order)
* hovering over most column headers will cause an arrow to appear in the right part of the column header, click on it for further options:
	* another way of sorting
	* a way of selecting additional columns to display
* most columns can be reordered by dragging and dropping the column headers

<div style="max-width: 450px;">

</div>

Most grids have "infinite" scrolling, which means that more rows will be loaded dynamically as needed (as you scroll, if applicable).
